## Project Description

This project is a React-based web application developed to demonstrate the use of **Context API** and **Redux Toolkit** for state management.

Authentication-related state such as login status, user name, and role is managed using **React Context API**, while product and cart data is managed using **Redux Toolkit**.

The application supports role-based access where an **Admin user** can add and delete products with prices, and a **Normal user** can view products, add them to the cart, and see the total cart price. A profile page is also included to display logged-in user details.

The project focuses on understanding separation of concerns, scalable state management, and real-world React application structure.
